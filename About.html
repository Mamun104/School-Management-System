Uttara High School & College stands on Dhaka-Mymensingh Road (Asian Highway) close to Azampur bus-stand. 
It is situated in the heart of Uttara Model Town about one kilometer from the zooming Zia International Airport.

 

The idea of Uttara High School & Colllege 
came from the fact that the necessity of a standard educational institution was immensely felt by the inhabitants of Uttara Model 
Town as it is cut off from the main city of Dhaka by a reasonable distance.

So, it was thought as a wonderful idea to have a public School of a very high standard which will admit boys
 and girls from all walks of life strictly on merit through admission tests. It is expected that their academic training at this great institution would
 make them physically and mentally sound enough to adjust and complete with the rest in the pursuit of higher studies. 
They would eventually turn out as complete men and women having full confidence in their ability in the challenging world.</p><hr>
